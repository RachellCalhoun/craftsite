# Craftsite
<h4>A Crafts and Cooking site</h4>

<p>This site's main function is a crafts and cooking open blog. Other users sign up and can post articles, images or comments.
There is a craft page with all the crafts listed, a detailed view page and for logged-in users there is a page for adding new posts and editing old.</p>
<p>There is also a comment function and page to add new comments.
All comments must be approved by admin before visible. Users can delete their own posts or their own comments.</p>

<p>There is an internal messaging system that I didn't create but integrated into my site, <a href="http://django-postman.readthedocs.org/en/latest/">django-postman</a>. Logged in users can message each other and admin, see sent, archived or deleted messages, and reply to recieved messages</p>
